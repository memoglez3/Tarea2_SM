    "* **A helping hand:**\n",
    "    While you probably will have no problem teaching your team some of the simpler Python concepts, higher level programming concepts will likely prove to be more difficult to impart.\n",
    "Depending on your comfort level when it comes to teaching and training, you may want to consider bringing in some extra help to get your team ready to conquer what might be an unfamiliar programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conquering a new language:** \n",
    "    While Python may seem intimidating to the uninitiated, once you’ve invested in the right training, you’ll find that it’ll be much easier for your team to pick up these concepts and apply them to company projects."
